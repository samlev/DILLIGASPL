Do I Look Like I Give A Shit Public License is a license for abandoned projects that you really don't give a shit about.

It's similar to the [Do What The Fuck You Want Public License](http://www.wtfpl.net), but a little more explicit about the fact that I don't give a shit.

It's released under itself.
